# Advanced-Cones
Blender addon for more complex cone-like shapes.

Mathematical explanations in this readme are adapted from [the Wikipedia article on nosecone geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nose_cone_design), use it for further reference

## Usage

Advanced Cones adds seven new types of cone shapes, primarily relevant for aerodynamic nosecone design. This image shows them with their default parameters. Left to right they are the tangent ogive, secant ogive, prolate hemispheroid (ellipse), parabolic cone, power series cone, Haack series cone, and spherically blunted cone.

All of the supported cone objects can be accessed through the Add > Mesh menu, or through Blender's search function

<details><summary><h3>Tangent Ogive (spherically blunted)</h3></summary>

<h4>Parameters</h4>

<h4>Mathematical basis</h4>

The profile of this shape is formed by a segment of a circle such that the rocket body is tangent to the curve of the nose cone at its base, and the base is on the radius of the circle

The radius of the circle forming the ogive, ρ, is found by

The radius y at any point x, as x varies from 0 to L is:

For a spherically-blunted tangent ogive (sphere radius > 0), the tangency point where the sphere meets the tangent ogive can be found from:

where rn is the radius and xo is the center of the spherical nose cap.

The apex point can be found from:

**Note that, for a spherically-blunted tangent ogive, the apex point is not at the apex length**. The apex length is the point at which the un-blunted ogive would terminate.

<details><summary><h3>Secant Ogive</h3></summary>

<h4>Parameters</h4>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/J3GtuTi.png" align=middle/>

<h4>Mathematical basis</h4>

Similar to a tangent ogive, except the ogive radius is a parameter, not a derived value, and the the base of the shape is not on the radius of the circle defined by the ogive radius (meaning a cylindrical extension below the ogive will not be tangent to the base of the curve). The ogive radius, ρ, must be at minimum sqrt(L^2 + R^2) / 2. If a smaller ogive radius is set for a fixed base radius and apex length combination, Advanced Cones will automatically reset it to the minimum allowable ogive radius (plus a small constant forced by how floating point numbers are handled). Similarly, if the base radius or apex length are increased beyond the allowable values for a fixed ogive radius, the ogive radius will be recalculated to the minimum.

The radius y at any point x as x varies from 0 to L is:

<details><summary><h3>Prolate Hemispheroid (Ellipse)</h3></summary>

<h4>Parameters</h4>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ltY1yuk.png" align=middle/>

The Smooth Tip checkbox doubles the number of rings calculated, using an additional n rings in the 1/nth (forward-most) section. Without this, the result is overly pointy

**Warning:** The prolate hemispheroid currently spawns upside down. This is a bug, it will be fixed in the next version

<h4>Mathematical basis</h4>

This is a half-ellipse, rotated about its center line. The radius y at a point x as x varies from 0 to L is:

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Parabolic Cone</h3></summary>

<h4>Parameters</h4>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xqFuJRE.png" align=middle/>

<h4>Mathematical basis</h4>

This shape is generated by rotating a segment of a parabola around a line parallel to its latus rectum. The radius y at a point x as x varies from 0 to L is:

<img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a5625ca045ac69b18cd4a812995b9b42a35d3a00" align=middle/>

Where K' is between 0 and 1, inclusive
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Power Series Cone</h3></summary>

<h4>Parameters</h4>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k3sesul.png" align=middle/>

<h4>Mathematical basis</h4>

The radius y at a point x as x varies from 0 to L is:

<img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d19693b8d04ed9f57664359b0d368474143a6e61" align=middle/>

where n is between 0 and 1, inclusive. n = 0 produces a cylinder, n = 1/2 produces a parabola, and n = 1 produces a plain cone
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Haack Series Cone</h3></summary>

<h4>Parameters</h4>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/52nvZzd.png" align=middle/>

<h4>Mathematical basis</h4>

Not geometrically derived, unlike the rest. The radius y at a point x as x varies from 0 to L is given by this pair of equations:

<img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5d697fec9f040425b6556e0e67807329f6aeaab" align=middle/>

where C >= 0. The Haack series cone for C = 0 is called the LD-Haack or Von Karman ogive, and gives the minimum drag for the given length and diameter. The Haack series cone for C = 1/3 is called the LV-Haack and gives the minimum drag for a given length and volume.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Spherically Blunted Cone</h3></summary>
  <h4>Parameters</h4>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YD5Qk1t.png" align=middle/>

<h4>Mathematical basis</h4>

Just a cone with a spherical cap on the end. The spherical cap is positioned such that the profile of the cone intersects the sphere at exactly one point, where the two curves are tangent to each other. The tangency point can be found as

<img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/453bf6fd3bd0e2345311beefdf2b40f5b7487d23" align=middle/>

where rn is the radius of the spherical nose cap. The center of the spherical nose cap, xo, can be found from:

## Compatibility

Advanced Cones v1.3 supports both Blender 2.79 and 2.80. It **should** support all of 2.7x, but this has not been tested. If anyone encounters issues with them, please report an issue, I will try to maintain backwards compatibility as long as practical. All screenshots in this readme were taken in Blender 2.79, but the functionality is unchanged in 2.80.

## Changelog

### v1.3

* Restored compatibility with 2.7x, same code now works on 2.7x and 2.8x

* Added spherically blunted cone

* Secant ogive now has correct base radius

* Secant ogive lower bound ogive radius relative to apex length and base radius is now correctly defined, parameters correctly rescale to restore sanity

* Removed unintended limit on Haack Series C value

* All cones now correctly spawn vertically (except prolate hemispheroid, see Known Issues)

* Added all cones to Add Mesh menu

* Reordered parameter layout to be more user friendly

* Text and metadata fixes

* Major overhaul of readme

### v1.2

* Updated for Blender 2.80 API changes

### v1.1.1

* ~~Final version for Blender 2.79 and earlier~~ (Update: v1.3 onwards restore backwards compatibility)

* Correct step sizes on float parameters

* Minor text and metadata fixes

### v1.1

* Correct name of prolate hemispheroid

* Add "smooth tip" option to prolate hemispheroid, correct bug where final vertex was not added

* Fix bug in secant ogive with minimum ogive radius relative to base radius and apex length

* Corrected default parameters for secant ogive to actually fit the secant ogive definition

* Objects now spawn at 3d cursor location, not scene center

### v1.0

* Initial release

## Planned features

* Set rotation at spawn

* New shapes: biconics

## Known issues

* Prolate hemispheroid spawns upside down (symptomatic of deeper problem and current hacky fix)

* Need to support inserting object while in edit mode

* Many unhandled limits of the mathematical definitions of each shape still exist and cause errors. The exception-based handling used in the secant ogive class is the current best solution, but still presents a problem in deriving the minimum offset to not crash the program. Further work needed
